    <h1>Ben's Favorite Pasta</h1>
    <p>A mustardy creamy pasta sauce I have committed to memory because it is Ben's favorite. Sadly, no photo exists
        because it is such a staple. It would be like taking a picture of a bag of flour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>pasta (dealer's choice)</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>shallots</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>hot italian sausage</li>
        <li>dijon mustard</li>
        <li>white wine</li>
        <li>lemon</li>
        <li>herbs (dealer's choice)</li>
        <li>marinara sauce or several heirloom tomatoes</li>
        <li>creme fraiche</li>
        <li>basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up a pan and put in butter and olive oil</li>
        <li>Sautee shallots and garlic, then turn up the heat.</li>
        <li>Separate hot italian sausage into chunks and toss it in the pan. We're aiming for crispy on most sides.</li>
        <li>Start your pasta.</li>
        <li>Once the sausage is browned, toss in 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard. Mix it up nicely with the sausage and
            shallots.</li>
        <li>Pour in half a cup of white wine and let it simmer. Then squeeze in 1/2 lemon.</li>
        <li>Toss in your chopped herbs and either several diced heirloom tomatoes or a few cups of marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>Let it cook.</li>
        <li>Strain your pasta but retain some pasta water for the sauce.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, put basil leaves into the sauce and half a cup of creme fraiche.</li>
        <li>Stir it all in until leaves have cooked (this will happen fast) and the sauce is orange.</li>
        <li>Toss your pasta into the sauce, mix it up and serve.</li>
    </ol>
