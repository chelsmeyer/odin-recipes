    <h1>Garbanzo Bean Salami Salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A salad I make constantly which is lifted, sadly, from TikTok virality. Salami forward. Beany.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Salad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>1/2 head iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>1 packet of salami</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 large cucumber</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>1 can garbanzo beans</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dressing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>tahini</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice romaine lettuce and iceberg into small pieces and put them in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Chop tomatoes and cucumber into small pieces and combine into bowl.</li>
        <li>Slide 1 packet of salami into thin strips. Separate as best you can and put em in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Strain a can of garbanzo beans, shake em dry, and put em in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Finely dice parsley and, you guessed it, put it in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Finely grate parmesan into the bowl. The salad tastes best if you use a lot! This is the most labor
            intensive part of the process.</li>
        <li>Combine salad dressing ingredients in bowl. Use common sense on ratios or look up how to make a homemade
            tahini dressing. I like using an immersion blender for the cherry tomatoes..</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now, ideally you've made a very large salad that will serve you for many days. I apply salad dressing liberally
        and on a per-serving basis so the lettuce stays as crisp as possible. Enjoy!</p>
